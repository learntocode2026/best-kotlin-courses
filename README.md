# Best Kotlin Courses for Android and Backend Developers

When Kotlin was first announced as an official language for Android development in 2017, I remember brushing it off. I thought: “Java is fine—why bother with something new?” But then I tried writing a few lines of Kotlin. The concise syntax, null-safety, and functional features made Java feel clunky by comparison. Before long, I was rewriting entire projects in Kotlin just because I enjoyed it more.

Fast forward to 2025, and Kotlin has moved far beyond being “just a Java alternative.” It’s now the go-to language for Android development, a rising star in backend systems (thanks to Ktor and Spring support), and even finding traction in multi-platform projects. Learning Kotlin doesn’t just make you a better Android developer—it makes you a stronger developer, period.

But as with any language, it’s easy to get lost in scattered tutorials, outdated documentation, and YouTube playlists that don’t go beyond the basics. That’s why I’ve curated the best Kotlin courses you can take this year. Whether you’re a beginner, an Android hopeful, or a backend engineer looking to explore Kotlin, there’s a course here for you.

My top recommendation is Educative.io’s Kotlin Guide, which provides an interactive, no-setup introduction to the language. However, I’ve also included other great options from Udemy, Coursera, JetBrains Academy, and more.

## 1. [The Ultimate Guide to Kotlin Programming](https://www.educative.io/courses/ultimate-guide-programming-in-kotlin) – Educative.io (Top Pick)

What makes Educative stand out is its browser-based, interactive environment. No setup, no IDE struggles—just open the course and start coding. That’s especially helpful for Kotlin, since beginners often get stuck setting up Android Studio or IntelliJ before they’ve even written a fun `main()`.

The course covers the essentials: variables, null safety, classes, functions, and lambdas. It introduces object-oriented programming and Kotlin’s functional features in digestible steps. And the inline practice means you’re not passively reading—you’re typing and debugging code as you go.

This is one of the best Kotlin courses for absolute beginners or Java developers curious about Kotlin. The trade-off is that it doesn’t dive into Android or multi-platform development, but that’s a good thing. It keeps you focused on the language before layering in frameworks.

## 2. Kotlin for Java Developers (Coursera, JetBrains)

JetBrains, the creators of Kotlin, teamed up with Coursera to offer this course. It’s tailored for Java developers who want to transition to Kotlin, showing side-by-side comparisons between the two languages.

You’ll explore null safety, data classes, coroutines, and functional programming—all while building on your existing Java knowledge. This makes it one of the best Kotlin courses if you already know Java and want a fast, structured bridge into Kotlin.

---

## 3. The Complete Kotlin Developer Course (Udemy)

This Udemy course is a massive, project-driven bootcamp. It starts with the language basics but quickly moves into real-world apps, including Android and backend projects.

What makes it one of the best Kotlin courses is its breadth. You don’t just learn syntax—you see Kotlin in action across multiple contexts. The trade-off is that it’s long (30+ hours), so you’ll need discipline to stick with it. But by the end, you’ll have projects to showcase on GitHub or your portfolio.

## 4. Android App Development Masterclass using Kotlin (Udemy)

If your primary goal is Android development, this is the course to take. It focuses squarely on building Android apps with Kotlin, covering layouts, activities, fragments, navigation, and Android Jetpack libraries.

It’s one of the best Kotlin courses for aspiring mobile developers because it doesn’t just teach the language—it teaches you how to use it in the ecosystem where it matters most.

---

## 5. Kotlin Bootcamp for Programmers (Google, Udacity)

Google partnered with Udacity to create this free course. It’s fast-paced and assumes you already know some programming, but it’s an excellent introduction to Kotlin’s modern features.

What makes it stand out is the credibility: it’s designed by Google itself, which means you’re learning Kotlin exactly the way Android’s maintainers want you to.

This is one of the best Kotlin courses if you want an official, no-cost way to get started.

---

## 6. Kotlin Essentials (Pluralsight)

Pluralsight’s Kotlin Essentials course is short but structured. It introduces the language fundamentals in digestible modules, making it perfect for busy professionals.

It won’t cover advanced app development, but it’s one of the best Kotlin courses if you just want a professional-level primer.

---

## 7. Developing Android Apps with Kotlin (Udacity, Google)

This is another official Google-backed course, but instead of just Kotlin basics, it dives straight into Android app development. You’ll build apps step by step, learning Android Studio, UI design, and Kotlin along the way.

It’s free and very hands-on, making it one of the best Kotlin courses for learners who want to go beyond the language and into actual Android projects.

---

## 8. Kotlin Developer Nanodegree (Udacity)

Udacity’s Nanodegree is more intensive and career-focused. It includes Android projects, code reviews, and mentorship. You’ll work with coroutines, architecture components, and best practices for scalable apps.

It’s pricier than other courses, but if you want structured, project-based training with feedback, this is one of the best Kotlin courses to invest in.

---

## 9. Kotlin Fundamentals by JetBrains Academy (Hyperskill)

JetBrains Academy offers a hands-on learning experience where you build real projects while learning Kotlin concepts. You’ll tackle challenges that integrate directly with IntelliJ IDEA, Kotlin’s primary IDE.

This is one of the best Kotlin courses for learners who thrive on project-based education. It’s more advanced than an entry-level course, so bring some programming background with you.

---

## 10. Kotlin for Android Developers (Ray Wenderlich / Kodeco)

Ray Wenderlich’s (now Kodeco) courses are beloved in the mobile dev community. Their Kotlin for Android Developers track is detailed, polished, and focused on practical Android projects.

It’s one of the best Kotlin courses if you want to dive into professional-grade app development with lots of tutorials and examples.

---

## 11. Advanced Kotlin Programming (Pluralsight)

Once you’ve mastered the basics, this course takes you deeper into advanced topics like coroutines, DSLs, and functional programming.

It’s one of the best Kotlin courses for developers who already know the language and want to sharpen their skills for production-level apps.
